# Wifi-Bot

A compact, ESP32-based robot that can be remotely controlled over Wi-Fi. This project demonstrates wireless control using an intuitive web interface served directly from the ESP32. Ideal for learning about embedded systems, motor control, and web-based communication with microcontrollers.

## Features

-  Wi-Fi AP/STA modes supported
-  Web interface hosted on ESP32
-  Real-time control keyboard keys
-  Dual-motor control
-  Battery-powered and portable

## Future Work

Integration of a speech-to-text API with the ESP32 firmware to enable voice-controlled robot movement.
